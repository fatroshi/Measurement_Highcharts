# Measurements with Highcharts
## About the project
An embedded system was created for audiotransmission in a wireless network.

A Carambola 2/ RPI 2 and Gstreamer were used for transmitting the audio, an Arduino UNO was 

used for measuring the total delay in the system, from sender to receiver.  

The measurements were stored in a .txt file.
